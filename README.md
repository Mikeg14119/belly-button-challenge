### Introduction


The human navel (belly button) is home to a diverse microbial community. The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard aims to make this intriguing dataset accessible to the public and researchers. By visualizing the microbial data in an interactive format, users can explore the variation in microbial species present in different individuals.


### Features


Horizontal Bar Chart: The dashboard features a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected test subject's belly button. Each OTU is identified by a unique ID.

Demographic Info: The dashboard provides demographic information for the selected test subject, allowing users to understand the correlation between microbial biodiversity and specific characteristics.

Bubble Chart: The bubble chart visualizes the abundance of OTUs in the selected test subject. Larger bubbles represent higher abundance, and the color scale represents the OTU IDs.


### Installation
